This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used used for testing code functionality and analyzing data generated from the simulations.
    * Python_Notebooks contains Jupyter notebooks that I generated while delopping the simulations and were primarily used for testing the functionality of code snippets and testing code.
    * R_Notebooks contains notebooks written in R and are where all analyses of simulation data are contained. Notebooks are named according to the datasets they analyze (see SEC_Data/).
