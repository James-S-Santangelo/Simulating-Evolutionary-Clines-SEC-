    "To build off of the previous single-population stepping stone model, I have added a few functions that allow us to add spatial structure to our simulations, effectively simulating the trajectory of multiple populations simultaneously. Once migration is added, this will be analogous to a metapopulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Major changes to script\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since there will be multiple populations, they are now stored as entries in a dictionary. Each key in the dictionarry corresponds to a population and the value is a list containing the frequencies of alleles phenotype, updated each generation. \n",
    "2. The alleles that correspond to each population are stored in a separate dictionary with keys matching those from the population dictionary. As such, allele frequencies for populations are calculated by sampling the allele lists in the 'alleles' dictionary with the key matching the population.\n",
    "3. Every generation, each population has some probability (p) of generating a new population with N alleles sampled from the population that created it. This is not the most realistic scenario but can easily be modified later. \n",
    "4. Simulations are now stored separately in a dictionary called 'sim' where each key corresponds to a simulation. \n",
    "5. These changes allow us to model clines in two ways:\n",
    "    - Clines across 'time': looking at phenotype frequencies **within** populations\n",

The logistic growth function incorporates a fractional constant that, when multiplied by the current population size, modifies the per capita growth rate of the population. The carrying capacity is thus altered by changing this fractional constant. \n",

    "3. Distances and migration rates are stored in a dictionary ('Dis'), which is re-created at the start of every generation since more populations may have been generated. The key's in this dictionary are concatenated strings formed from the union of all pairwise combinations of existing populations.
