    "## Simulate non-cyanogenic evolution via drift alone\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a finding that across a cline from less to more urban the frequency of a non-cyanogenic phenotype increases\n",
    "The phenotype is genetically controlled by two loci, both of which have a segregating knock-out allele\n",
    "If any individual is homozygous for either knockout they become non-cyanogenic\n",
    "\n",
    "In this extremely simple simulation I create a 'population' which is represented by 2 lists of alleles (A/a and B/b)\n",
    "To simulate evolution I randomly sample with replacement from the lists to create new list that represent the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By repeating this process with variable starting frequencies, population sizes and numbers of generations (functionally equivalent to steps in a strict stepping stone) we can look at the change in the frequency of cyanogenic and non-cyanogenic phenotypes"

    "## Extension to previous simulations â€” Spatial structure\n",
    "\n",
    "To build off of the previous single-population stepping stone model, I have added a few functions that allow us to add spatial structure to our simulations, effectively simulating the trajectory of multiple populations simultaneously. Once migration is added, this will be analogous to a metapopulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Major changes to script\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since there will be multiple populations, they are now stored as entries in a dictionary. Each key in the dictionarry corresponds to a population and the value is a list containing the frequencies of alleles phenotype, updated each generation. \n",
    "2. The alleles that correspond to each population are stored in a separate dictionary with keys matching those from the population dictionary. As such, allele frequencies for populations are calculated by sampling the allele lists in the 'alleles' dictionary with the key matching the population.\n",
    "3. Every generation, each population has some probability (p) of generating a new population with N alleles sampled from the population that created it. This is not the most realistic scenario but can easily be modified later. \n",
    "4. Simulations are now stored separately in a dictionary called 'sim' where each key corresponds to a simulation. \n",
    "5. These changes allow us to model clines in two ways:\n",
    "    - Clines across 'time': looking at phenotype frequencies **within** populations\n",
    "    - Clines across 'space': looking at phenotype frequencies **across** created populations"
