    "1. Since there will be multiple populations, they are now stored as entries in a dictionary. Each key in the dictionarry corresponds to a population and the value is a list containing the frequencies of alleles phenotype, updated each generation. \n",
    "2. The alleles that correspond to each population are stored in a separate dictionary with keys matching those from the population dictionary. As such, allele frequencies for populations are calculated by sampling the allele lists in the 'alleles' dictionary with the key matching the population.\n",
    "3. Every generation, each population has some probability (p) of generating a new population with N alleles sampled from the population that created it. This is not the most realistic scenario but can easily be modified later. \n",
    "4. Simulations are now stored separately in a dictionary called 'sim' where each key corresponds to a simulation. \n",

The logistic growth function incorporates a fractional constant that, when multiplied by the current population size, modifies the per capita growth rate of the population.
