This directory contains execuatable R-scripts that take as input the datasets returned from the simulations and produce as output the summary datasets found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s25nz9fwrwj29j2/AADpYF5F3oSjzuCNI5nlbjhqa?dl=0). The R-scripts are named according to the simulations and data that they analyze (see README.md file in previous link for naming conventions).
