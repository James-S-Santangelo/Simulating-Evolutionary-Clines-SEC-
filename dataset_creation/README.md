This directory contains execuatable R-scripts that take as input the datasets returned from the simulations and produce as output the summary datasets found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nwqfc1pkfqg2hsn/AAA2vTDkLhjsSNoBVRfpZr8Ka?dl=0). The R-scripts are named according to the simulations and data that they analyze (see README.md file in previous link for naming conventions).
