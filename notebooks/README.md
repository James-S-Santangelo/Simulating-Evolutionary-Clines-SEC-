This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used used for testing code functionality and analyzing data generated from the simulations.
* Python_Notebooks contains the following two notebooks:
    * _Logistic-Pop-Growth_: Provides an example of how logistic population growth is modelled in our simulations.
    * _selection-affect-LD_: Small simulation exploring the build up of LD between _CYP79D15_ and _Li_ loci when selection is acting on HCN.
* R_Notebooks contains notebooks written in R and are where all analyses of simulation data are contained. Notebooks are named according to the datasets they analyze (see data files [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nwqfc1pkfqg2hsn/AAA2vTDkLhjsSNoBVRfpZr8Ka?dl=0) and the README.md files in the zipped data folders).
